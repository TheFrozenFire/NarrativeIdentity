# Narrative Identity

Following is a software project proposal describing an piece of software that
attempts to marshal the psychological concept of
[Narrative Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_identity) into
an information system. The intended application of this software would be
therapeutic, either as a self-therapy option, or for use by medical
professionals and researchers as a tool for performing sophisticated systems
analysis of patients' self-narratives.

The original over-arching concept of this project is that a "life narrative"
can be quantized into a series of nested narratives that combine to form one's
narrative identity. These narratives don't necessarily proceed linearly through
time, but rather exist as somewhat distinct stories that one tells oneself,
while overlapping, connecting, and proceeding in cause-and-effect relationships.

As a therapeutic option, this software would provide a framework in which to
develop coherence - temporally, causally, thematically, and in a cultural
context. The software would also use potentially use lexical and sentiment
analysis to suggest forms of narrative content on which to reflect and
elaborate.

By enumerating and categorizing the content of a life narrative, connections
between events and individuals - particularly in the context of
[Attachment Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory) - can be
laid out for reflection and analysis.

Instances of Contamination and subsequent Redemption can be connected over
time to establish whether unresolved issues exist in an individual's life
narrative.

Instances of Agency can be enumerated to discern the opportunities that an
individual has been presented with which have resulted in personal growth,
by which one might seek out similar opportunities for growth in the future.

Identifying instances of Communion could help in determining an individual's
connectedness to their friendships and relationships.
